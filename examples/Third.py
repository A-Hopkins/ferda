"""
This is the third example. This example is an introductory lesson into
object-oriented programming (OOP). Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of
"objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures.

What that means is in code you would have an object, Plant, that contains information about the Plant, like height,
color and you have functions that control those fields of data. Like grow() to increase height.

The usefulness of OOP is to encapsulate your data so things you don't expect to modify it cannot modify the information.
It is also useful to hide data.
